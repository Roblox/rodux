There are two supported ways to get started with Rodux.

For our examples, we'll install `Rodux` to `ReplicatedStorage`. In practice, it's okay to install Rodux anywhere you want!

### Method 1: Model File (Roblox Studio)
* Download the `rbxmx` model file attached to the latest release from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/Roblox/Rodux/releases).
* Insert the model into Studio into a place like `ReplicatedStorage`

### Method 2: Filesystem
* Copy the `src` directory into your codebase
* Rename the folder to `Rodux`
* Use a plugin like [Rojo](https://github.com/LPGhatguy/rojo) to sync the files into a place
